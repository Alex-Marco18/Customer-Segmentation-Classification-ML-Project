## 📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for customer segmentation and classification — helping businesses understand customer behavior and personalize marketing strategies.
We first segment customers using unsupervised learning (K-Means) and then train a supervised classifier (XGBoost/RandomForest) to predict which segment a new customer belongs to.
Finally, we deploy the trained classifier in a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction.

## 🧩 Business Objective
Businesses often have large amounts of customer data but limited insight into customer types.
This project aims to:

Identify distinct customer groups based on their demographic and spending behavior.
Predict which segment a new customer belongs to.
Enable personalized marketing strategies and better decision-making.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1️⃣ Problem Definition
Define the business goal and ML problem (unsupervised + supervised learning).

2️⃣ Data Collection
Use the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset (Kaggle).
Columns include:
CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values
Encode categorical features (e.g., Gender → 0/1)
Scale numeric features using StandardScaler
Create new behavioral features:
Spending_Efficiency = Spending Score / (Annual Income + 1)
Income_Spend_Interaction = Annual Income × Spending Score

4️⃣ Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised)
Apply K-Means clustering to group customers.
Determine optimal k using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Label clusters (e.g., low-spending, average, premium).

5️⃣ Customer Type Classification (Supervised)
Use cluster labels as target (y) to train a classifier.
Model used:
Random Forest


Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Save best model using joblib.

6️⃣ Model Deployment (Streamlit App)
Deploy the classifier model via Streamlit:
User enters Gender, Age, Income, and Spending Score.
The app predicts their customer segment.
Tabs and sidebar make the UI clean and interactive.
